# Helping Hands

Helping Hands is a charity website that is purely made using html and css. The website takes contributions from the users in forms of food, medicine and clothing  and provides real life aid for the less fortunate. The users can enter what type of contributions and the amount of it in the website and in turn the website generates a date and time in which the give away of these items will be done. 

This is our final project after the completion of HTML & CSS. We are four members working on this project Sanjib Roy, Sudarshan Shinde, Naveen Reddy and Akshay Pradeep.Presently we have designed UI only, we will add functionality and backend part further.
